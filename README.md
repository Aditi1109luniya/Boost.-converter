# Boost-converter
Designed and implemented a buck converter with 10 V input and adjustable 2–8 V output, supporting up to 1 A load current.
Operated the converter in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) at 20 kHz, and analyzed key waveforms including inductor current and switch voltage.
Reduced switching frequency to demonstrate Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM), capturing characteristic waveform shifts.
Evaluated and compared converter performance in CCM vs. DCM in terms of efficiency, ripple, and transient behavior.
#output 
Achieved regulated output voltage range of 2 V to 8 V from a 10 V input across varying load conditions.
Successfully demonstrated Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) at 20 kHz with smooth inductor current waveform and stable output.
Observed Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) behavior by lowering switching frequency, showing distinct current waveform drop to zero.
Analyzed and compared efficiency, ripple voltage, and dynamic response between CCM and DCM operations.
Captured and interpreted key waveforms (inductor current, switch voltage) for both modes using simulation tools.
